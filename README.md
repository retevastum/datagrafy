# datagrafy (german: [datengraphie](http://datengraphie.de))

## Overview

* datagrafy is a form of data / information art (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information_art>) and digital art
* It uses arbitrary data (Pictures, Video, Audio, Text, Numbers) as source material
* But i also uses raw data as "drawing material"
* That makes datagrafy unique
* Artefacts (Datagrafies) are created by self-developed software (currently datengraphie 1.5.0.1), while source materials may stem from third parties
* Datagrafies may be graphics, video or audio
* Datagrafies consist of Daxels (Pi-xel -> Data-xel -> Da-xel), which have ususally x and y > 1. Pixels are with x==y==1 special cases of daxels
* Datagrafies as a whole are usaully quite large (1m x 1m up to 5m x 5m). Because of that they have to be scaled down for being shown digitally. This implies, that one of the core characteristics of datagrafy is not visible when shown digitally: The detail level when getting close and the existence of superordinate structure while being far
* Especially for Video-Datagrafies (Mode: datengraphie.vid*) current off-the-shelf PCs may be a challenge - or: vice versa. Videos with resolutions > 4000 are not easy to be played
* datagrafy defines Iconography of data - the visual language of data

## Examples

1. Drawing with letters (Mode: datengraphie.txtrgb)
   * A picture and a text are used as input
   * The picture is transformed and gets drawn on / by the text
   * Sample below shows ["Gretchenfrage"](http://datengraphie.de/#gretchenfrage)
   * [![datagrafy: Gretchenfrage on Youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NKTXUwDd8Ik/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKTXUwDd8Ik)
2. Drawing with audio (Mode: datengraphie.pcmrgb)
   * An audio-file and a picture are take as input
   * The picture is transformed and gets drawn on / by the audio data
   * Sample below shows ["0,000016"](http://datengraphie.de/#kosmos*sol) in the series "kosmos"
   * [![datagrafy: 0,000016 in the series kosmos on Youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/H1QehUBTKAE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1QehUBTKAE)
3. Drawing with audio (Mode: datengraphie.vidpcmrgb)
   * An audio-file and a video are taken as input
   * The Video is transformed frame-by-frame and gets drawn on / by the audio data; synced with the audio data, so that the audio data is visible as it gets played
   * Sample below shows ["Ludwig auf Daten"](http://datengraphie.de/#aufd*luad) in the series "auf daten"
   * [![datagrafy: Ludwig auf Daten in the series auf daten on Youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Fdtn_74kkSk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdtn_74kkSk)
   
## Series

Many Datagrafies are aggregated in series, as they deal with similar contents or are similarily structured in a technical way - in a broad sense

* [biblioism](http://datengraphie.de/#bib) for example is about the transformation of books and texts. The Datagrafy [Gottes Buch und des Digitalen Beitrag](http://datengraphie.de/#bib*gottesbuchunddesdigitalenbeitrag) (which roughly translates to: God's book and Digital's contribution) is based on Luther Bible (Revision from 1912) and a numerical series consisting of hits of every book in the bible in a not so well known search engine (Mode: datengraphie.txtrgb)
* [graphlaut](http://datengraphie.de/#gl) deals with the transformation of data into "music" (graphlaut is by the way the reason for having "drawing material" in quotes - sounds get "drawn"). The Datagraphy [Diffus](http://datengraphie.de/#gl*diffus) shows kind of a special effect. Here music is created from a picture (Mode: datengraphie.rgbpcm). In the next step that music is taken as input to the creation of a picture from music (Mode: datengraphie.pcmrgb). With well chosen parameters the picture created in the second step shows a form of the initial picture - the visual got encoded in music. Some people may recognize Mr. Franz Kafka.
* [lautgraph](http://datengraphie.de/#lg) as a last example is about creating pictures from music / audio. The Datagraphy [Entzug der Sinne](http://datengraphie.de/#lg*entzugdersinne) (which roghly translates to: Deprivation of senses) simply shows the transformation of one piece of music - nothing else - green on black, music.
